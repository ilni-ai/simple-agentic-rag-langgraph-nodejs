LangGraph.js is a JavaScript framework for building stateful, agentic applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It enables developers to model complex workflows as graphs of reasoning steps.

LangGraph promotes graph-based reasoning, memory, and autonomy in AI applications.

LangGraph is especially useful for applications like study assistants, chat agents, and autonomous tools.

LangGraph applications are built using nodes (steps) and edges (transitions).

Each node in LangGraph performs a task, such as retrieving documents, generating a response, or reflecting on an answer.

Edges define the flow between nodes. LangGraph supports conditional edges through routing.

The entry point defines where the graph begins processing the user input.

LangGraph supports route nodes, which dynamically decide the next node based on model output.

LangGraph.js integrates well with LangChain, Gemini, and vector databases like FAISS.

Agentic behavior is the ability of the system to decide next actions, reflect, and adapt its behavior.

Reflection is implemented as a node that takes in a response and outputs a recommended next step.

Memory is implemented using external systems like SQLite to store conversation turns.

LangGraph passes the full state from node to node, so you can accumulate history and retrieved data.

LangGraph agents typically follow a flow like: retrieve → generate → reflect → route → follow-up or summarize.

LangGraph is declarative — you define what the graph should look like, not how to control flow manually.

This improves maintainability and clarity in building AI systems.

LangGraph is designed for multi-step reasoning tasks — where you want more than a one-shot LLM call.

LangGraph is better suited than simple pipelines when you need autonomous action selection or memory.

LangGraph can be extended with custom tools, web search APIs, or calculators in advanced agents.

LangGraph is used in educational agents, customer service bots, research assistants, and more.

LangGraph.js is a new JavaScript-native version of the LangGraph framework, making it accessible to frontend and Node.js developers.

LangGraph brings agentic AI capabilities to the JavaScript ecosystem with a declarative graph-based structure.
